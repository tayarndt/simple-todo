# simple-to-do
a simple todo list script  in python. Reads items out of a text file and writes to a text file. This is a client for the todo.txt system.

## usage
You can use this program by running the .exe file. When the program first opens,you will get a message that explains we need to create a new text file. This text file is important as it stores your items for your list. Next, you will have a message that says file created successfully.

### menu
The menu is where you can either read, add, or get help. You can read your tasks by typing  the R key. The case doesn't matter as the program  will except both. If you press A, you will be presented with a prompt that says task name:. From here enter a name of a task you want inserted in the file. To exit and go back to the main menu, press E. Again, the case doesn't matter. I you press H; you will get some help with commands in the program.
